1. Create a new Vite React project
   - Run: npm create vite@latest my-shop -- --template react
   - cd my-shop
   - npm install
   - npm run dev

2. Inside the src/ folder, create a new file named Product.jsx that 
   returns and exports a Product component.

3. In the Product component, return an <h1> tag with the text 
   'Product Details' inside, and an empty <img> tag below it.

4. How/where would you make a fetch request to the API 
   at: https://fakestoreapi.com/products/1 
   in order to get the product's image and show it inside the <img> tag? 
   (You can also show the product title, price, and description as a BONUS.)

   âœ… You should use both useState and useEffect hooks for fetching and storing data.

5. Import the Product component into main.jsx and replace <App /> 
   with <Product /> to test that it works in your Browser.

BONUS* 
ðŸ‘‰ Display the product title, price, and description below the image.
